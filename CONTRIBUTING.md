# H1 Team Norms:

# H2 Team Values:

- Team will ideally meet in person at least once during each sprint while they work on the project. Outside of this in person session, team members will communicate with each other using voice and video channels, screen sharing, and messaging. 

- If a team member needs help they can ask other team members through the private discord channel or over imessage. Team members will be available to help each other with debugging and other issues one may encounter with their individual contributions. However, no member should rely on another member to complete their tasks for them. 

- If a team member is not able to deliver on their obligations before the next standup, they should let the rest of the team know at least 24 hours in advance. The rest of the team will then meet to discuss how to divide up that person’s workload. 

- During weekdays, team members are expected to respond to messages from other members within a 24 hour period. On the weekends, this is extended to a 32 hour period. 


# H2 Sprint Cadence:

- Each sprint will last approximately 2 weeks. 

# H2 Daily Standups:

- Daily standups will take place Mondays and Fridays at 6 pm and will last approximately 30 minutes. These meetings will occur over discord or zoom.

- Members will not cover for other members that do not participate. 

- A member who makes no progress on a task for two standups or more in a row will be reported to management.


# H2 Coding Standards:

- VS Code and eslint will be used by all team members. 

- Write descriptive comments and commit messages.

- Make frequent commits; don’t commit a large amount of code all at once.
