# CoinMaster:moneybag:

## Description of project

CoinMaster is a cryptocurrency tracker that shows the real-time information on cryptocurrency prices and events. It helps build your portfolio with a few clicks. Users can compare data on different coins and see the latest news. It allows beginners to watch tutorials and learn crypto basics.

This is different from a cryptocurrency exchange platform, since users will not hold their funds on this platform. For example, if you prefer to store your crypto in a hardware wallet but you still want to keep up with price movements throughout the day, choosing CoinMaster is less complicated than signing up for an exchange.



## Product Vision Statement

For cryptocurrency investors who need to track the prices and latest news of cryptocurrencies, CoinMaster is a website that is easy to build a portfolio and keep   track of the crypto market. 
	  
Unlike other cryptocurrencies tracker, CoinMaster allows users to trade with virtual money for practice and compare the performance of   different    cryptocurrencies.

## Project History
As college students who are interested in investing in the Crypto Market, we find it difficult to find a tool that is beginner-friendly. Thus we want to build a software that is easy for tracking prices/news and simulates the real investing process.
